# Terraform Google Wrappers

A collection of opinionated terraform modules for working with Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Target use cases include personal projects and early stage startups. In general, the modules here aim to:

1. Simplify the configuration. Avoid legacy settings and enable useful features.
1. Keep costs low. Even with these settings, GCP still guarantees 3 to 4 nines of reliability.
